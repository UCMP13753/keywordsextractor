2,2,header,A MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO
3,2,paragraph,"Over the last decade we have focused on putting the student first and we believe we set the standard in how to support the modern learner. If we want to build and maintain a long term relationship with students, we must listen to the issues that are important to them. Our students, along with our employees, investors, management team, and board care that we operate sustainably minimizing the environmental impact of our business, that we invest in and support our employees, that we contribute to our communities and that we operate our business with integrity. We accept this responsibility. We have increased our efforts to build out programs that support our environment, employees, communities, and contribute positively to the learning ecosystem."
4,2,paragraph,"The pace of evolution within the learning ecosystem has accelerated in recent years as students and educators increasingly embrace digital platforms to enhance learning, teaching, and accessibility. Weve seen new learning pathways emerge and global educators now serve a much more diverse learner audience than previous generations. 55 of Cheggs learners are now minorities, 35 are working part time, another 11 are working full time, and 20 have a family income of less than 20,000 . Chegg meets these modern learners where they are by offering a flexible on demand learning platform, where we are proud to serve 30 million learners each month. We strive to improve the overall return on education investment by helping people learn more in less time and at a lower cost."
6,2,paragraph,"Weve also seen the challenges of the last few years dramatically impact students in school and beyond, exacerbating an existing crisis in student mental health and financial stability. Thats why we launched Chegg Life to support more of students needs. Chegg Life will initially focus on personal finance, soft skills, mental health and wellness, and we believe this support will help Chegg serve more global learners even better."
7,2,paragraph,Chegg seeks to always serve as a valued and responsible member of the learning ecosystem. Weve taken measures to help uphold and protect academic integrity in support of authentic learning and we are building an entirely new educator economy that will connect educators to learners around the world to increase access to trusted high quality and relevant learning content.

9,3,paragraph,"We know that the heart of Chegg is our incredible employees. They are one of our biggest competitive advantages, and it's our responsibility to take care of them and provide a diverse and inclusive culture where everyone feels empowered to do their best work. In 2021, we expanded employee training and continuing learning opportunities, enhanced our recruiting process to increase the diversity of our workforce, and we improved our transparency by disclosing workforce metrics such as gender and ethnic diversity among employees and our leadership, employee engagement feedback, and employee retention, among other items."
10,3,paragraph,"In 2021, Chegg collectively donated 1,400,000 to organizations whose initiatives benefit learners globally and our communities. We align the major themes of our philanthropic and community efforts with the U.N.s Sustainable Development Goals, including a heightened focus on quality education, good health and well being, and moving to a world with zero hunger. Our recent social impact efforts have included announcing the winner of our first Chegg.org 100,000 Global Student Prize, and our immediate responses to crises including a 100,000 donation to the International Rescue Committees Education in Emergencies program for the conflict of Afghanistan, and another 100,000 donation to Save the Children for the recent Ukrainian crisis. We moved quickly in response to the heartbreaking situation in Ukraine and began offering Ukrainian refugees a free premium subscription to Busuu, the language learning service we acquired in early 2022."
11,3,paragraph,"The challenges of the last few years have had a dramatic impact on all of us, particularly students, and Chegg will always be with them on their entire journey; academically, professionally, and beyond. As you will see in the following pages, our 2021 ESG Report highlights our progress on ESG initiatives. We are proud of our work as were continuously improving, looking for more ways to help our students, their communities, our employees, and the environment. In 2021, we conducted our first formal materiality assessment, through which we gathered feedback from students, employees, investors, professors, and other key stakeholders, and the conclusions are helping us prioritize our sustainability roadmap going forward."
12,3,paragraph,We are a mission driven company with an enormous opportunity ahead of us. Our employees are energized each day by the important and fulfilling work we do for global learners and the positive impact we can have on their lives and their learning and professional outcomes. We look forward to engaging further and continuing to support the issues that matter most to our stakeholders. We are so incredibly grateful for all of you that have been a part of our journey.

15,4,paragraph,"When it comes to our most valuable resource, our people, Cheggs North Star continues to be meeting our employees where they are. We regularly solicit feedback, which helps guide our best in class benefits, learning programs, and development opportunities, which are important to our employees no matter what stage of life they are in, such as our unique Student Loan repayment offerings including our Equity for Education program. We are always looking for ways to make our work environment more diverse and inclusive, and a place where employees with all backgrounds and experiences feel supported personally and professionally. We do this by supporting our ERGs with access, content, and funding, by providing our hiring managers with tools to help reduce unconscious bias in the hiring process, or by offering training resources that aim to instill an inclusive and diverse workplace culture. All of this helps us attract and retain top talent."
16,4,header,"Debra Thompson, Chief People Officer"
17,4,paragraph,"At Chegg, we take our position within the education eco system extremely seriously. We honor students by continuously enhancing content quality, depth, personalization, and diverse formats. We believe this relentless student first mission will yield increasingly positive learner outcomes for students around the world no matter how or when they learn best. By investing in our proprietary concept taxonomy, we believe we will create discrete and definable learning pathways to improve the ROI on their education. Our scalable model allows us to provide great value while increasing access to education for global learners. We honor faculty by building a global platform where they can share and be compensated for their valuable teaching material and instructional expertise, and we continue to engage with and support educators in our common goal of upholding academic integrity."
18,4,header,"Nathan Schultz, President Learning Services"
19,4,paragraph,The viability and health of societies will soon depend on equipping large numbers of workers with the skills to fill roles in a new digital economy.
20,4,paragraph,"Without a major boost to digital skills, as a society we are not going to be able to fill their digital needs, create new opportunities in developing economies, or reduce unemployment and underemployment rates. There are huge advantages for companies that digitally upskill their staff. The more digitally literate weas a societyare, the more we can create efficiencies that contribute to environmental sustainability. We believe employers have an increasing duty to support employee upskilling and we are proud to be a partner on that journey."

The COVID 19 pandemic exacerbated many ongoing challenges in education, including how students are assessed and how they use online resources. We believe educators must be engaged to reimagine how they teach, assess, and support students as everyone adjusts to a new normal that includes more virtual learning. As a leader in education, and because of our commitment to authentic learning, we have taken steps to improve academic integrity. And we continue to evolve and do more.
