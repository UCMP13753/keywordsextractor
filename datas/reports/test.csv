" If we do not attract more students or if students do not increase their level of engagement with our platform, our revenues  may grow more slowly than expected or decline. The student demographic is characterized by rapidly changing tastes,  preferences, behavior, brand loyalty, and price sensitivity. Developing an enduring business model to serve this population is  particularly challenging. Attracting new students depends not only on investment in our brand and our marketing efforts, but  also on the perceived value of our products and services versus alternatives. If our efforts to satisfy our existing student user  base are not successful or become less effective, or if the cost of such efforts were to significantly increase, we may not be able  to attract new students as successfully or efficiently and we may not be able to retain existing students on our platform. As a  result, our business, growth, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.  ",marketing

"Laws or regulations may be enacted which restrict or prohibit use of emails or similar marketing activities that we  currently rely on. For example: CAN-SPAM regulates unsolicited commercial emails and imposes civil and criminal penalties  for abusive practices; the FTC imposes penalties on companies for misleading and deceptive marketing practices; TCPA  restricts telemarketing and the use of automated telephone equipment; and CCPA requires us to make certain disclosures  regarding our marketing practices, allows consumers to opt-out of certain data sharing practices. Newly enacted laws such  CDPA and CPA will place additional restrictions on our marketing practices. ",marketing
"The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable  future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, display, processing, transmission and security of personal information by  companies offering online services have recently come under increased public scrutiny. The U.S. government, including the  White House, the FTC and the U.S. Department of Commerce, have reviewed the need for greater regulation of the collection  and use of information concerning consumer behavior with respect to online services, including regulation aimed at restricting  certain targeted advertising practices. The FTC in particular has approved consent decrees resolving complaints and their  resulting investigations into the privacy and security practices of a number of online, and social media companies. On June 18,  2020, we received a CID from the FTC to determine whether we may have violated Section 5 of the FTC Act or the COPPA, as  they relate to deceptive or unfair acts or practices related to consumer privacy and/or data security, as further described in Note  12, Commitments and Contingencies, of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,  Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Similar actions  may also impact us directly, particularly because of the current subject of the CID and because high school students who use  our Chegg Writing and Chegg Prep services, may be under the age of 18, which subjects our business to laws covering the  protection of minors. For example, various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful  to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. Although our  services are not primarily directed to children under 13, our Chegg Writing service or our Chegg Prep service, in particular,  could be used by students as early as in middle school, and the FTC could decide that our site now or in the future has taken  inadequate precautions to prevent children under 13 from accessing our site and providing us information.

Although we endeavor to comply with our policies and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be  accused of having failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other documentation that provide commitments  about data privacy and security can subject us to potential actions if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or otherwise  misrepresent our actual practices, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of  operations. In addition, compliance with inconsistent or new privacy and cybersecurity laws could impact our business  28 strategies and the availability of previously useful data, increase our potential liability, increase our compliance costs, require  changes in business practices and policies and adversely impact our business.

"In the ordinary course of business, we collect, process, store, and use personal information and data supplied by students  and tutors. We may enable students to share their personal information with each other and with third parties and to  communicate and share information into and across our platform. If we were to disclose data about our student users in a  manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation and brand could be adversely affected, and we could face legal  claims that could impact our results of operations. In addition, there are numerous federal, state, and local laws regarding  privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, using, processing, disclosing and protecting of personal information and other user  data, including from minors under the age of 18, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and which  may be costly to comply with and may be inconsistent between countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules.

"We believe that adhering to our core value of putting students first is essential to our success and in the best interests of  our company and the long-term interests of our stockholders. In the past, we have forgone, and in the future we may forgo,  short-term revenue opportunities that we do not believe are in the best interests of students, even if our decision negatively  impacts our results of operations in the short term. For example, we offer free services to students that require investment by us,  such as our Chegg Internships service, to promote a more comprehensive solution. Our philosophy of putting students first may  cause us to make decisions that could negatively impact our relationships with publishers, colleges, and brands, whose interests  may not always be aligned with ours or those of our students. Our decisions may not result in the long-term benefits that we  expect, in which case our level of student satisfaction and engagement, business, and results of operations could be harmed. ",students
" The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of student records and gives students (and  their parents in the case of minors), certain rights (such as data correction and data production), with respect to their student  records. FERPA restricts the circumstances in which we can disclose student records. In addition, many states have passed  student privacy laws, some of which are more restrictive than FERPA, and therefore do not pre-empt FERPA. ",data security
" In 2021 Chegg broadened its reach to more students, especially internationally, and we took another  step when we closed our acquisition of Busuu in early 2022. The fast-growing, $17 billion, digital  language learning category is especially important to learners, with 55% of U.S. college students  reporting needing help learning a foreign language. By offering more content to more students, we are  continuing to position ourselves as forward-thinking and student-focused as we support their academic  success in more ways.  ",programs
" Moreover, as the education industry continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state, and foreign agencies  becomes more likely. For example, California adopted the Student Online Personal Information Protection Act which prohibits  operators of online services used for K-12 school purposes from using or sharing student personal information, Illinois adopted  the Student Online Personal Protection Act which went into effect on July 1, 2021 and regulates how we collect and process  data, and Colorado adopted House Bill 16-1423 designed to protect the use of student personal data in elementary and  secondary school. These acts do not apply to general audience Internet websites but it is unclear how these acts will be  interpreted and the breadth of services that will be restricted by them. Other states may adopt similar statutes. Additionally, for- profit postsecondary institutions, many of which provide course offerings predominantly online, remain under intense  regulatory and other scrutiny. Allegations of abuse of federal financial aid funds and other statutory violations against for-profit  higher education companies, even if unfounded, could negatively impact our opportunity to succeed due to increased regulation  or decreased demand for our offerings.

"The globalization of learning driven by the internet has created access to knowledge for millions of  students worldwide who are eager for tools that empower them for both academic and career  success. However, innovative technologies that expand opportunities can also be misused. At Chegg,  we believe that academic integrity is fundamental to the learning process and core to our mission.

For example, the release of iOS 14 on Apple devices brought with it a number of new changes, including the need  for app users to opt in before their identifier for advertisers (IDFA) can be accessed by an app. Apples IDFA is a string of  numbers and letters assigned to Apple devices which advertisers use to identify app users to deliver personalized and targeted  advertising.
